# Natural Language for Visual Reasoning

This repository contains data for [NLVR](https://github.com/clic-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr) (Suhr et al. 2017) and [NLVR2](https://github.com/clic-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr2) (Suhr and Zhou et al. 2018).

Natural Language for Visual Reasoning is the task of determining whether a sentence is true about a visual input such as an image. This requires reasoning about sets of objects, comparisons, and spatial relations. This includes two datasets: NLVR, with synthetically generated images, and NLVR2, which includes natural photographs.
